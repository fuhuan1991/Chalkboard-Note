# My Portfolio website

This is my portfolio website. It is built by Reat, Spring and postgreSQL, deployed on AWS.
It contains:
* A little bit about myself and my experience

* Chalkboard Note: An online note app built by React and Spring. You can create and modify your note on this app. Your note will be stored on the database.

* Reversi game: This is a little game like Reversi. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.
